# stock-analysis 



## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to assist Steve with researching the stockmarket to help his parents choose investments. The dataset and code includes the entire stock market over the last few years.  


### Purpose
The code execution was not fast enough before but with refactored code we'll see this script will execute faster. 


### Results

-  I added 4 pictures (timers with refactored code and without) as you can see there is a significant difference between refactored code and old code.

Refactored code in this case helps us get results faster. Imagine if Steve had a very large dataset for sure it would help to analyze the code faster.


### Summary 
1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
- the benefit of  refactoring code is script runs fast and dataset can be analyze in short amount of time.
-It takes time or maybe years of experience of programming to figure out what type of refactoring code can be more effective.
- It can be hard for larger code to be refactored

2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
 script  runs  faster when we do  refactoring, but it takes a lot of time to test codes line by line to make sure everything is working fine and code can get results.
